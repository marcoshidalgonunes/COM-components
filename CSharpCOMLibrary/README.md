# C# COM Library

This is the C# implementation of ```COMLibrary.BeepEmitter```, an example of COM Component using features of ```System.Runtime.InteropServices``` namespace.

To this development, the ".NET desktop development" workload must be deployed in the Visual Studio installation.

The target is [.NET Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/interop/exposing-dotnet-components-to-com) instead .Net Core, due better support for Windows centric applications and components.
